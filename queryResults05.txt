This bill is about entry into school and entry into, basically it's about enrollment into school. So there is continuous to be informed consent for immunizations and if the parents say, I don't want to get my child immunized. Then the child is not immunized. That is what will happen. And then when they decide they want to enroll their child in school, then the school will say, well, is your child immunized? Then if they decide not to have their child immunized, under this bill, they would have to seek out other options like home schooling or independent study. That's what this bill is about. But, the decision whether to immunize or not, is a decision that's made between the child's parents or guardian, and the health profession that is providing the immunization."},
