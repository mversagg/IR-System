The SB 277 bill has gone through a series of modifications and
amendments during the timeframe of the dataset (the committee
hearings took place on different dates). I am interested in
finding out more about any specific changes the bill, amendments
that the authors wound up including, or any amendments that
might have been discussed regardless of whether or not they
made it into the future versions of the bill.
